In this project it shown my first use of my new REACT skills as well as existing SCSS and JavaScript knowledge.

It was really interesting to work on this project. the lessosn were helpful as we learnt about props, arrays and state to help me along in the process.

I used MAP, state and props to help me achieve the goal as well as writing a plan, using psuedocode and many logs along the way.

Going forward i will need to refactor my code in App.jsx and use a mix of state and props to store the add function in its own component.
The add function does work however the code could be nicer and more efficient.

As well as this to get the search function to work.
